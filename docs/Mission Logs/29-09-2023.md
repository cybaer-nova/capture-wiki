In this trial, the drone from IST was used in more autonomous waypoint flights. The drone behaved as expected apart from the yaw angle which did not correspond to the desired values. Also, the drone from NOVA was used for manual payload tests, managing to fly without issues with 2Kg and with some stability issues with 3Kg which was considered a success.
