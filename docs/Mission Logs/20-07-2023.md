In this trial, the drone from IST was used in several manual and GPS flights in order to test safety modes based on GPS navigation such as the return-to-launch mode. Tests using different payloads were also conducted, adding 1kg, and 2kg payloads and hovering in Position mode, yet the drone revealed to be near instability when carrying 2kg, for which further PID adjustment is needed, and when landing, it tilted forward and two propellers were damaged. After replacing the propellers, removing the weights, and checking for airworthiness, a basic offboard mode test was conducted, using waypoints describing a square.
