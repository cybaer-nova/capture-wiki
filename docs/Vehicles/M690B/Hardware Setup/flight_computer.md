# Flight Computer

The flight computer for this vehicle consists of a [**Holybro Pixhawk 6C**](https://holybro.com/collections/autopilots-peripheral/products/pixhawk-6c) board. To communicate with the board, the USB-C port can be used. Alternatively, the TELEM (1,2,3) ports can be used together with an FTDI adapter. In the latter, the [documentation](https://docs.px4.io/v1.12/en/companion_computer/pixhawk_companion.html) shows how to wire the cable between the TELEM port and the FTDI adaptor.
