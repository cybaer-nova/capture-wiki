# Onboard Computer

The onboard computer for this vehicle consists of an [**NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/) board which is installed in the [**Connect Tech Photon**](https://connecttech.com/product/photon-ai-camera-platform-jetson-xavier-nx/) carrier board. The specific version of board is the **REV G**, **SN5320**, **NGX002**. Additionally, a 1 TB NVMe SSD was installed in the M.2 2280 M-KEY slot in the carrier board. To ensure the use of the SSD is enabled, the onboard DIP switch *SW1-2* should be on the ON position. More information regarding the operation of the carrier board and connector location can be found in the [carrier board manual](https://connecttech.com/ftp/pdf/CTIM_NGX002_Manual.pdf).
