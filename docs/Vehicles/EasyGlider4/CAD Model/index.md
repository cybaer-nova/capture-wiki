The following Cad models of the easy glider 4 were developed:

- [easyglider-bode(one piece).zip](../../../assets/EasyGlider4/easyglider-body_one_piece.zip){:download="easyglider-body-one-piece"}
- [easyglider-body.zip](../../../assets/EasyGlider4/easyglider-body.zip){:download="easyglider-body"}
- [easyglider-supports.zip](../../../assets/EasyGlider4/supports.zip){:download="easyglider-supports"}

The body was based on a 3D scan made of the vehicle.
The support structure was made to hold the rasberry pi above the servos and the pixhawk 6c mini behind it.
